\section{Final Remarks}
\label{reflexivity:final-remarks}

The aim of this chapter is to offer a positionality stance for me. Bearing in mind that the researcher is a primary instrument in a qualitative investigation, it is essential to understand this chapter as a part of my data collection in this research. In future research projects, I want to conduct reflexivity activities in a more collaborative way from research group meetings according to recommendations of \citeonline{paulus:2010}.
