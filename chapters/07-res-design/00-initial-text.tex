\chapter{Research Design}
\label{chap:res-design}

 Once I carried out the discussion about the research methodology, more specific steps needed to be defined. Research design informs us in more detail about all methods or techniques used for conducting research. In this moment, I describe the instantiation of context, sampling, and other essential information for research decision-making. 
 
I arrange the remainder of the chapter as follows. Section \ref{res-des-sec:context} presents the research context where I conducted the research. Section \ref{res-des-sec:active-learning} delineates the active learning context where this research is immersed. At last, Section \ref{res-des-sec:phd-route} details my \gls{Ph.D.} route, describing the main phases of the research walking.
