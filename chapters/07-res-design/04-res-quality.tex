We will promote the research quality by addressing key aspects of qualitative research validity such as credibility, consistency, transferability, and research ethics \cite[p.~239]{merriam:2016-ethics}. Triangulation, researcherâ€™s position (see Chapter \ref{chap:reflex-essay}), and auditing trail shall be used. We will submit the study design to the institutional ethics review board.
