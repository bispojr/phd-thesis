\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}

 I structure this chapter into three sections, matching each \acrfull{RG} mentioned previously (see Section \ref{intro-sec:goals-pres}). Section \ref{disc-sec:sdl-trajectories} looks to understand Chavo's and Quico's \gls{SDL} trajectories (\gls{RG}1). Section \ref{disc-sec:sdl-capabilities} defines \gls{SDL} capabilities, mapping its main elements in Chavo's and Quico's \gls{SDL} trajectories through an analysis of the ``taking the initiative'' capability (\gls{RG}2). Finally, Section \ref{disc-sec:recommendations} presents a set of equity publications addressing guidelines to (\gls{CSE}) educational stakeholders concerning how to apply this discussion in their concrete context (\gls{RG}3).
