\chapter{Research Methodology}
\label{chap:res-methodology}

As important as knowing how to use methods and techniques during a research project, it is crucial to understand what and why to adopt them. Research methodology addresses questions like this justifying the proposed research design. \citeonline[p.~8]{kothari:2004} asserts that 
\begin{citacao}
    “Researchers not only need to know [...] how to apply particular research techniques, but they also need to know which of these methods or techniques, are relevant and which are not, and what would they mean and indicate and why”.
\end{citacao}
In this chapter, I present the discussion about the research methodology and, in Chapter \ref{chap:res-design}, the research design proposed for this project.

The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. Section \ref{res-met:qualitative-research} presents what I consider to be qualitative research, the reasons to adopt it, and situates the philosophical framework that underlies the assumptions of this research. Section \ref{res-met:data-collection} discusses the data collection both from the perspective of why I chose a specific technique and how the strategy to get research samples. Finally, Section \ref{res-met:data-analysis} justifies the methods used to conduct the data analysis.
